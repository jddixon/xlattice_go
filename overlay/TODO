    * passing "172.16/12" to NewCIDRAddrRange() resulted in a
        null pointer exception; must track this down

    * Overlay is badly named; it is a base type and should be       # FIXED
        named accordingly
    * if the transport for an overlay is "ip", IsElement() should   # DONE 
        regard "udp" and "tcp" as acceptable
    * in the longer run, Transport should be a real abstract type 
        and should support a partial ordering (so that for example 
        "ip" < "tcp" < "http" < "https")
    * improve use of Golang abstractions such as IPNet in
        AddrRange

    * need to add validation of addrRange to ip_overlay.go
    * need to add addr range to test                                # DONE
